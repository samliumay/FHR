# FHR (Fog and Haze Remover)

Project that focuses on:
-	integrating all the Well known dehazing algorithms to the one program
-	Gave researchers a program that can be easily used for research
-	People with hazy images can dehaze their photos and have it from the program
-	Releasing our research results from this project.

## To Use:
```
git clone https://github.com/samliumay/Fog_and_Haze_Remover.git
cd Fog_and_Haze_Remover
python main.py
```
