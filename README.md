# Fog and Dehaze Remover

Project that focuses on:
-	integrating all the Well known dehazing algorithms to the one program
-	Gave researchers a program that can be easily used for research
-	People with hazy images can dehaze their photos and have it from the program
-	Releasing our research results from this project.

There are also some classified aims. Could be announced at the future.
