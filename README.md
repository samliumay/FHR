# Fog and Dehaze Remover

Project that focueses on:
- integrating all the Well known dehazing algorithms to the one porgram 
- Gave resarchers a program that can be easly used for resarches
- People with hazy images can dehaze their photos and have it from the program
- Relasing our resarch results from this project.

There are also some clasified aims. Could be anounced at the future. 


## To Use:
```
git clone https://github.com/samliumay/Fog_and_Haze_Remover.git
